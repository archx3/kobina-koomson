Not too long ago, I was catching up with my friend, Obeng, both of us standing in front of his dad's house, a block away from mine. Obeng is a chemical engineer now, brilliant guy, but the conversation that day took us far from titration curves and thermodynamics.

We reminisced about our childhood days and teenage years in Accra.
Back then, we’d spend hours in his dad’s garage or sometimes on his front porch in Tabora No. 6, tearing apart old radios, TVs, and VHSs and building makeshift circuits with dreams bigger than Accra's skyline. We were kids who thought we could fix anything, from radios, dreams, maybe even the world, with scrap components we pillage from the electronics repairs shop nearby.
Those moments were pure. Our own version of Silicon Valley in Tabora, minus the venture capital and artisanal coffee, of course.


That day, though, our tinkering dreams had matured, and so had the surrounding context. We found ourselves talking about something that used to be a footnote in our high school Social Studies lessons —**brain drain**. Back then, it was a distant concept, a textbook term, something to memorise for exams.

Our teachers described it with righteous disapproval:

> *"The phenomenon where African professionals leave the continent in droves in search of greener pastures, thereby robbing us of our own talent."*

It felt like someone else’s problem, doctors going to Canada and the US in the 70s, 80s, and 90s, accountants ending up in London, or nurses heading to Germany.

Now, though, standing here in our thirties, it's no longer just in the textbooks. It's reality unfolding right in front of our eyes, as real as the sweat on my brow.
Almost all of our friends have left the country's shore or are planning to do so, I retorted.

#### The Numbers tell a tale

Sources indicate significant emigration among educated Ghanaians. For instance, a 2021 Gallup poll noted that Ghana has one of the highest emigration desires globally, particularly among the educated, with 78% of those with post-secondary education considering emigration. Additionally, UNESCO data estimates that 18,782 Ghanaian tertiary students were studying abroad in 2020.

These numbers are only going to grow, especially post-pandemic.

Between **2022 and 2024**, over **4,000 Ghanaian nurses** left the country to work in the UK alone, many of them trained in our public institutions, only to take their skills elsewhere due to low wages and limited opportunities.

And it’s not just the health sector. A 2023 report from the *African Union Development Agency* noted a surge in African tech workers. Developers, engineers, data analysts, leaving for Europe, the U.S., and increasingly, the UAE.

These days, it feels like every other LinkedIn update is someone announcing their move to study or work in Berlin, Amsterdam, or Toronto.

But here's the twist. Not everyone is physically relocating any more.

#### The Remote Work Paradox

Both Obeng, now a digital consultant, and I, a software engineer, despite staying put in Ghana, work for companies overseas. From not so different front porches from where we once melted plastic and fried circuit boards and home offices, we now write software, design systems, attend standups across time zones, attend to clients and earn in **foreign currency**.

Obeng consults for a healthcare company in the US; I build software for a startup in Madrid and a fintech in Berlin. 
...And we’re not alone. Remote work has exploded, letting Ghanaian techies tap into global markets without leaving Accra. Platforms like Andela, Tunga, my own friends' **Codeln**, and many others connect African developers to international gigs. Companies like Zoom and Microsoft are hiring locally for remote roles as the allure of cheaper labour from here, in comparison with US hires, is too good to pass up.

This new trend, **staying local but working global**, has become the sweet spot for many African professionals. We get the best of both worlds: proximity to family and community, but compensation that actually stretches our cedi salaries into something resembling a living wage.
Working from home being the cherry on top for some.

And with the Ghana cedi doing its biannual disappearing act against the dollar, we’re not exactly mad about it.

But there’s an undercurrent to this setup that bothers me.

We’ve started to **celebrate the brain drain**, not because it's stopped, but because it's changed clothes.
The cost? Ghana loses roughly $1 billion annually due to brain drain, factoring in the investment in education and lost economic output.
Nearly all remote workers pay no taxes on their income, and the government may not even be aware of the cost.

Looking across the African continent, the picture is just as grim. The African Union estimates 70,000 skilled professionals leave Africa yearly, with nine countries, including Ghana, losing over $2 billion since 2010 just from training doctors who then migrate. In 2019, 2.1 million sub-Saharan Africans lived in the US, a 16-fold increase since 1980, with 53% hailing from Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Ethiopia, or Somalia. These aren’t just numbers, they’re the coders, engineers, and doctors who could be building Ghana’s future but are instead powering economies elsewhere.



The danger is clear: Africa risks becoming a talent exporter, not a tech hub. Without skilled professionals, healthcare systems crumble. Case in point: Nigeria’s doctor-to-patient ratio is 1:5,000 compared to 1:254 in developed countries. Tech innovation stalls, and the continent’s ability to compete globally weakens. It’s a vicious cycle: underfunded systems push talent out, and their absence makes it harder to build the infrastructure needed to keep others.

#### A New Dress, Same Old Problem

Today’s brain drain is no longer just about physical migration. It’s about **intellectual displacement**. The brains stay in Ghana, but their value, their output, their allegiance, goes elsewhere.

And we’ve grown to love it. Because who doesn't want to earn in USD while living in a cedi economy? Who doesn't want to see their salary triple overnight because of where the client is based?

Even the government has joined the bandwagon. In a bizarre twist of logic, some officials now promote migration as a **form of job creation**. We train nurses and doctors with taxpayer money, then “export” them like cocoa beans. Remittances roll in, everyone claps. But what’s the long-term cost?

For Ghana's tech ecosystem in particular, my biggest peeve has been the sharp decline in mentorship and talent nurturing. When I was starting out my software engineering journey, one of the things I felt was missing was a sense of community and a desire to learn from more experienced developers yet not knowing who to turn to. Imagine my joy when I found a couple of local developer communities springing up some time after I graduated university.
Unfortunately, these communities are now often led by folks who are only focused on their remote gigs and making next to no effort on helping nurture the next generation of local talent. The result? A generation of developers who are good at following instructions but not enough with the foundational skills to innovate or lead.

## Remittances: Blessing or Band-Aid?

In 2023 alone, **Ghana received marginally close to $4.7 billion** in remittances, representing over **6% of GDP**. That’s more than the country made from gold exports that year.

Sounds like a win, right?

But remittances are a crutch. They soften the blow, but they don’t solve the root problem: **a system that fails to make staying worth it**.

We’re building a pipeline that exports hope and imports cash. But no amount of cash can compensate for the absence of skilled minds in our hospitals, our classrooms, our labs.

We’re slowly gutting our future to pay for the present. It’s like selling your best players mid-season and hoping the bench can win the league.

#### Can We Solve This?

Honestly? This is a hard problem.

The forces pulling our talent abroad, or online, are powerful: better pay, stability, **respect**, access to tools. If there's one thing we can learn from the new trend, it's that evidently, the cause isn't just about wanting to live in countries with better infrastructure with better quality of life but primarily about better opportunities. not about stopping migration, after all, people will always chase better opportunities anyway.

But that doesn’t mean we’re powerless.

##### 1. We need systems that reward skill locally.
Not just through salaries, but through dignity, safety, and growth opportunities. A young developer in Accra should not have to beg for a fair salary while a less experienced peer in Europe earns 10x more.

##### 2. We need infrastructure that attracts and retains talent.
Tech hubs, research labs, startup accelerators with actual funding, not just press releases. We should be exporting solutions, not people.

##### 3. We need policies that rethink migration incentives.
Encouraging people to leave isn’t a development strategy. Let’s fund institutions, support local innovation, and incentivize return, not exodus.

##### 4. We need to shift the narrative.
Brain drain isn’t just about people leaving. It’s about why they feel they must leave, and why staying feels like settling.

#### A Closing Thought

Obeng and I still tinker, just with higher stakes now. But I can't help but wonder what would’ve happened if we’d stayed in that garage, built something big, and had the support to scale it right here in Ghana like Steve Jobs and uncle Wozniak did.
We ended that part of our conversation with the all too popular Ghanaian expression: "hm, ɛyɛ asɛm oo" and moved on to the next.

Maybe one day that’ll be possible. Maybe the next wave of kids soldering wires on their porches in Madina or Dansoman won’t need to pick between dreams in Ghana and departure.

But until then, we’re stuck in this strange new chapter of brain drain, dressed in Wi-Fi, Zoom, and forex accounts.
