A quick, practical story about turning a humble Google Doc into a professional download button for the web — and what I learned about Google Docs URLs along the way.

### The Problem I Didn’t Know I Had

Like many folks, I keep my resumé in Google Docs. It’s easy to update, looks clean, and I can share it with a link when needed.

But recently, I rebuilt my small personal website (this one). You know, the usual "Hi, I’m [Your Name]" kind of thing. And on it, I wanted a **Download Resumé** button. Simple idea.
The first version was just a link to a PDF file I had downloaded from Google docs and uploaded somewhere. But that felt clunky and outdated. I wanted something better.

<br/>

###### What I *didn’t* want was:

- To keep re-uploading a PDF version every time I updated the doc.
- To use weird third-party PDF converters.
- To deal with file storage, authentication tokens, or complicated setups.

>I thought: **"There must be a way to serve the latest version of my Google Docs resumé as a PDF directly."**

Spoiler: There is.

### A Beautifully Simple Solution

Here’s what I discovered — and it blew my mind with how simple it is:

>📎&nbsp; Every Google Doc has a hidden export URL that lets you download it as a PDF (or other formats) with just a GET request.

#### The Magic Link Format

```bash
https://docs.google.com/document/d/{DOCUMENT_ID}/export?format=pdf
```

Just replace `{DOCUMENT_ID}` with your actual doc ID, which you’ll find in the URL bar when editing the doc:

```
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aBcD123XyZ_PQRSTuvWxyzAbcDEFGhijkLMNOPqrstu/edit
```

Here, `1aBcD123XyZ_PQRSTuvWxyzAbcDEFGhijkLMNOPqrstu` is the document ID.

### Making It Work on Your Site

Once you have the export link, you can turn it into a real download button using plain HTML or JavaScript — no frameworks needed.

###### ✅ HTML-Only Way

```html
<a 
  href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/your-doc-id/export?format=pdf"
  download="resume.pdf"
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
>
  Download Resumé
</a>
```
<br/>

###### ✅ JavaScript Way

This gives you more control (like triggering it from a button):

```html
<button onclick="downloadResume()">Download Resumé</button>

<script>
  function downloadResume() {
    const url = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/your-doc-id/export?format=pdf";
    const link = document.createElement('a');
    link.href = url;
    link.download = "resume.pdf";
    document.body.appendChild(link);
    link.click();
    link.remove();
  }
</script>
```

> ✅ Works perfectly if the document is **public** (or at least “Anyone with the link can view”).

## But Wait — What Else Can Google Docs Do?

While poking around, I found a few other **undocumented or semi-documented** URLs for Google Docs that might come in handy:

### 1. 📄 View the Document in Different Modes

These are browser-facing modes — not API endpoints.

| URL Pattern | What it does |
|-------------|--------------|
| `/edit`     | Opens editable view (if you have permission) |
| `/view`     | Read-only preview |
| `/preview`  | Clean preview (no toolbar, good for embedding) |

Example:

```
https://docs.google.com/document/d/{DOC_ID}/preview
```

---

#### 2. 📥 Export to Other Formats

Besides PDF, you can export your doc as:

| Format | URL query |
|--------|-----------|
| PDF    | `?format=pdf` |
| DOCX   | `?format=docx` |
| ODT    | `?format=odt` |
| RTF    | `?format=rtf` |
| TXT    | `?format=txt` |
| HTML   | `?format=html` |
| EPUB   | `?format=epub` |

So yes — you could even let people download your resumé as an EPUB if you were feeling fancy.

---

#### 3. 🔒 Want to Hide the Google Docs Link?

In some cases, you may want to:

- Mask the actual Google Docs URL
- Log how many people downloaded your resumé
- Apply security or access rules

In that case, you can use a **serverless function** (e.g., via Netlify or Vercel) as a proxy. It would fetch the export link server-side and stream the result to the user.

Here’s a simplified version of what that might look like (Node.js-style pseudocode):

```js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const docId = 'your-doc-id';
  const url = `https://docs.google.com/document/d/${docId}/export?format=pdf`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const blob = await response.arrayBuffer();

  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/pdf');
  res.setHeader('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename="resume.pdf"');
  res.send(Buffer.from(blob));
}
```

### Final Thoughts

This little trick solved a very real problem for me, and honestly, it feels like a bit of magic. Google Docs gives us a super simple way to maintain a **live source of truth** for something as important as a resumé, while still offering a professional download experience on the web.

So whether you’re building your personal site, a portfolio, or just need a way to share your resumé without babysitting file versions…

> 📎 **Just use that `export?format=pdf` URL.**

---

### TL;DR

- ✅ Use the Google Docs export URL to serve live-updated PDFs.
- 📎 Make sure your doc is shared as "Anyone with the link can view".
- 🧩 Bonus: Use serverless if you need customization or control.
